## Overview
This is our ASU Capstone Project for the Fall 2023 and Spring 2024. We are being sponsored by the Disruptive Radio Team at General Dynamics Mission Systems to create a web-based asset tracking tool that tracks local assets in a given space. To develop this tool, we incorporate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an aesthetic UI, paired with MySQL to hold a database of existing assets.
